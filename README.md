# Shell

An example shell implementation in C, using system calls. Made as part of my Systems Programming course, will continue work on it.

## TODOs

* [ ] Implement background command parsing - &.
* [x] Refactor the code a bit, add modularity and functions.
* [x] Add ability to pipe commands
* [ ] Add ability to redirect STDIN and STDOUT, why not STDERR, too
* [ ] Abstract piping into a working function
* [ ] Add some structure to the project

## Bugs

* [x] Fix trimming spaces and tabs from end of command.
* [ ] Fix ignoring spaces between command and its arguments

## Wild ideas

* [ ] Add colours to commands
* [ ] Something other than bash commands?
* [ ] Integrate a text editor?
