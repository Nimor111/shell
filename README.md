# Shell

An example shell implementation in C, using system calls. Made as part of my Systems Programming course, will continue work on it.

## TODOs

* [ ] Implement background command parsing - &.
* [ ] Refactor the code a bit, add modularity and functions.

## Bugs

* [ ] Fix trimming spaces and tabs from end of command.

## Wild ideas

* [ ] Add colours to commands
* [ ] Something other than bash commands?
* [ ] Integrate a text editor?
